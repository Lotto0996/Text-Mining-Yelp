# Text-Mining-Yelp
## Abstract
In this project we investigate a variety of
regression and classification models to predict
rating from given review text. It was found that
Ridge regression with TFIDF unigram features
worked the best in terms of Mean Squared Error.
We investigate the model performance on data
from different cities and conclude that our model
is robust to changes in rating distribution. Also,
we show that the text based models should be
used with caution across regions since they are
sensitive to language. Additionally, it is observed
that it may be better to use different models for
different time periods (seasons or years).
Visualizing the word clouds give valuable insights
about region, culture as well as its correlation to
seasons and ratings.
